This project is a data analysis and visualization initiative aimed at understanding the sales performance of a pizza business. By leveraging Power BI, the project explores key metrics and trends to uncover insights that can drive operational improvements and strategic decision-making. By calculating and visualizing KPIs, the dashboard provides actionable insights into revenue, order trends, and product performance.

The dataset contains pizza sales records, including details like order IDs, pizza categories, sizes, timestamps, and revenue etc. Data cleaning involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats.

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
The dashboard calculates the following metrics to understand business performance:
1. Total Revenue: The sum of all pizza orders' total prices.
2. Average Order Value: The average spend per order, calculated as total revenue divided by the number of orders.
3. Total Pizzas Sold: The total number of pizzas sold across all categories.
4. Total Orders: The total count of orders placed.
5. Average Pizzas Per Order: The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated as total pizzas divided by total orders.
